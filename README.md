# ###############
Working with authentication and authorization to control everything on the system

- For roles

-Admin
-User


- For Privileges (* in the Spring you have to you privilege or permission instead of authority becasue the default name convention inside framework is authority so you have to use what recommend at first to avoid the conflict)

-Create

-Edit
-Delete


Besides that, using Multi-Factor Authentication for system access


Using Open Documentation API for Swagger (SpringDoc and open api 3)
